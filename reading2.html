        I really like how this article approaches the new era of AI, instead of being hung up on whether something is AI, being suspicious of any content we come across to try and determine if we were being deceived, we look for expressiveness, and stop engaging with bland content. This pushes us to create works that are expressive. There was definitely bland content before AI, but now that we have AI, it makes us more aware of the limitations of these types of works, and pushes us to actually express and make connections beyond the generic. It makes me think of my own writing, which my friends have, on multiple occasions, told me sounds like AI. I consume a lot of AI generated content, and since my writing has not been fully developed yet, I am learning from AI, learning how to write from AI, which has, in turn, turned my writing more robotic. I also like the rubric the author uses for his students. It pushes them to be expressive, instead of a lot of other classes that have very solid requirements for how things should be done. I think this type of rubric (that the author uses), discourages students to use AI, while other types may incentivize students to use it, which inhibits their learning.
