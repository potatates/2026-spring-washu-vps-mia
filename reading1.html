        This article really made me think of the intentions of designs, and the actual messages communicated by them. I would often look at very unpolished “unpretentious” designs, and wish for them to be more perfect, for them to follow design rules and be more pleasing to the eye. To think that maybe these unpolished designs communicate a personality I didn’t see before is interesting. Maybe it’s good that not all things are perfect, otherwise nothing may be communicated and the message will be lost. I think Jasmine has a very valid point about the actual reality of restaurants that I agree with: you can’t afford a content manager most of the time, and these platforms and templates do make it more realistics for restaurants to run a website.
