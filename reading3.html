       I like how he thinks about computer technology in these two categories – rooms and cyborgs. I’ve never really considered them that way, especially considering wearables to be cyborgs, since it seems  very fictional and far away. But after reading this, I think that is basically what we’re doing. We’re enhancing our human abilities and capabilities with wearable technology. I don’t know if I agree with him that rooms are overlooked. I feel like I always see videos about new household robots being developed. Although his distinction of “rooms” did remind me of “The Veldt” by Ray Bradbury, a 1950 sci-fi short story. I think this connection I made really  connects with “Both can be done in good ways and ugly ways.” I think people may feel more spooked with the cyborg aspect, but the rooms can be equally dangerous if not executed right.
