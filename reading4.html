       I like how this article addresses how it’s normal to feel stressed etc when using social media, since user happiness is not their primary focus. That reminds me of a documentary we had to watch for college writing (“The Social Dilemma”). They also talked about how us as users are the products being sold, instead of just the audience. I also like the sentiment of decentralizing the internet. I think the internet, like anything else, would be better without a monopoly and more fluidity. I really like the bird pictures with speech bubbles, they remind me of my blog in elementary school. I really like how the article talks about the effects of using a metaphor like a cloud for the web – it mystifies it, like it’s some typr of intangible, nebulous entity, instead of the quite solid and understood thing that it is.
